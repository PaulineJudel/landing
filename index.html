			<h1>Our mission & values</h1>
			<p>It's time to react and change your habits!

			We want to help make sustainable, environmentally conscious commerce the new norm. We inspire conscious commerce by offering reliable, quality products that create an authentic positive impact. Together, we aim to contribute to a healthier planet by changing the way we shop.

			To that end, we have created our own e-commerce site that lists all the sites that offer responsible and environmentally friendly products. 

			As consumers, we can influence real change by making environmentally friendly purchases, but we know it can be hard to find environmentally friendly products. That's why we created our e-commerce site, Towards A Greener World.

			We make it easy for you to buy products made with sustainable materials. We give you easy access to earth friendly products. 

			With your help, we are forming a community capable of making a far-reaching impact. Together we can create positive environmental change.</p>

			<h2>Discover ecological and responsible products</h2>
			<p>All the brands we offer are environmentaly friendly. Why are they environmentally friendly? The products are made with recycled products, do not use single-use plastic or are vegan. We have several categories of produtcs: clothings, skincare, make-up, food storage, cleaning...and many others!</p>
